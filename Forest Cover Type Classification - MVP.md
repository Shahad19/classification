# Forest Cover Type Classification

### Minimum Viable Product

The goal of this project is to predict the type of forest covers from factors (e.g. elevation, distance to water source, hill shade during the day...).

To reach this goal, we used multiple classification models to predict the target with the highest accuracy.

From the above figure we can see that the elevation factor may have a significant positive impact on our predictions.

From this figure we can see how many predictions our k-Nearst Neighbors (kNN) model were correct and how many were wrong, on a subset of the data.
